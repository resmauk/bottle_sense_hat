# Bottle Sense Hat Demo

Allows control of the LEDs via a webpage served by the Bottle web framework library

Run bottle_sense_hat.py and load the webpage served at http://pi_ip_address:8080/bottle

You can control the LEDs, read the data from the temp, pressure and humidity sensors and send text to the Sense Hat to scroll across the LEDs (sense.show_message("Hello")).
